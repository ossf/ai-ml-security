## Technical Charter for Open Source Security Foundation 

## AI/ML Security Working Group

### Adopted 4 March, 2024

This Technical Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the OpenSSF AI/ML Security Working Group open source community, which has been established as a Working Group (the "Technical Initiative") under the Open Source Security Foundation (the “OpenSSF”).  All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Technical Initiative (collectively, “Collaborators”) must comply with the terms of this Technical Charter and the OpenSSF Charter. 

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Technical Initiative

We are an incubating WG is going through the initial life cycle phases to address open source software security for AIML workloads. The developing scope involves analyzing open source AIML data sets, data models and OSS code mashups used in AIML to articulate the specific security concerns and controls for the subset of OSS AIML workloads.  This is important because the accelerated adoption of AIML has an OSS and security component that is not well understood, and OpenSSF can play an industry leading position.

This committee interlocks with the [LF Data and AI](https://lfaidata.foundation/projects/) foundation monthly to avoid effort duplication.

Roadmap goals: [high level efforts for upcoming 18 months]
* Create high two level white papers, one an executive overview and the other directed at practitioners  and industry leadership positions (can work with Marketing committee for broad distribution)
* Explore a “security slam” for existing OpenSSF tooling to see how it protects/applies to OSS AIML workloads; develop OSS security patterns for use cases where OSS AIML components are integrated in the supply chain.
* Coordinate with other working groups to examine crossovers and gaps.

## 2. Technical initiative roles

- a. The primary points of contact are the lead and co-lead of the Technical Initiative, who are listed in the [README](https://github.com/ossf/ai-ml-security/blob/main/README.md).

- b. The Technical Initiative generally will involve Collaborators and Contributors. The Technical Initiative may adopt or modify additional roles so long as the roles are documented in the Technical Initiative’s repository. Unless otherwise documented:

  - i. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes effort, ideas, code, documentation, or other artifacts to the Technical Initiative;

  - ii. Collaborators are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify ("commit") text, source code, documentation or other artifacts in the Technical Initiative’s repository or direct the agenda or working activities of the Technical Initiative; and

  - iii. A Contributor may become a Collaborator by majority approval of the existing Collaborators. A Collaborator may be removed by majority approval of the other existing Collaborators.

  - iv. Maintainers are the initial Collaborators defined at the creation of the Technical Initiative. The Maintainers will determine the process for selecting future Maintainers. A Maintainer may be removed by two-thirds approval of the other existing Maintainers, or a majority of the other existing Collaborators.

- d. Participation in the Technical Initiative through becoming a Contributor, Collaborator, or Maintainer is open to anyone, whether an OpenSSF member or not, so long as they abide by the terms of this Technical Charter.

- e. The Technical Initiative collaboratively manages all aspects of oversight relating to the Technical Initiative, which may include:

  - i. coordinating the direction of the Technical Initiative;

  - ii. approving, organizing or removing activities and projects;

  - iii. establish community norms, workflows, processes, release requirements, and templates for the operation of the Technical Initiative;

  - iv. establish a fundraising model, and approve or modify a Technical Initiative budget, subject to OpenSSF Governing Board approval;

  - v. appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities;

- f. The Technical Initiative lead is responsible for

  - i. facilitating discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical matters relating to the Technical Initiative; and

  - ii. coordinating any communications regarding the Technical Initiative.

  - iii. approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing (to be published in the Technical Initiative repository) and coordinating with the Linux Foundation to resolve matters or concerns that may arise as set forth in Section 6 of this Technical Charter;

- g. The Technical Initiative co-lead is supporting the lead in their duties. In the absence of the lead, they can

  - i. facilitate discussions, seek consensus, and where necessary, vote on technical matters relating to the Technical Initiative; and

  - ii. coordinate any communications regarding the Technical Initiative.

## 3. Voting

- a. While the Technical Initiative aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any decision requires a vote to move the Technical Initiative forward, the Technical Initiative will vote on a one vote per member basis.

- b. Quorum for Technical Initiative meetings requires at least fifty percent of Collaborators to be present.


- c. Decisions by vote at a meeting require a majority vote of those in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote without a meeting require a majority vote of Collaborators.

- d. In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the Technical Initiative, the group lead may refer the matter to the TAC for assistance in reaching a resolution.

## 4. Compliance with Policies

- a. This Technical Charter is subject to the OpenSSF Charter and any rules or policies established for all Technical Initiatives.

- b. The Technical Initiative participants must conduct their business in a professional manner, subject to the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). The TSC may adopt a different code of conduct ("CoC") for the Technical Initiative, subject to approval by the TAC.

- c. All Collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Technical Charter and any policies adopted for all Collaborators by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Technical Initiative community must not seek to exclude any participant based on any criteria, requirement, or reason other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all Collaborators in the Technical Initiative community. All activities conducted in the Technical Initiative are subject to the Linux Foundation’s Antitrust Policy, available at [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy/).

Any potential violations of this requirement should be reported immediately to the TAC.

## 5. Community Assets
